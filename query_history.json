    "question": "What is the main argument of the text?",
    "answer": " The main argument of the text is that the problem of caste in Indian society cannot be solved through social reform alone, but requires the destruction or overthrowal of the authority and belief in the sanctity of the shastras (scriptures). According to the text, as long as people believe in the infallibility of the shastras, they will never be able to get rid of caste. Therefore, the real remedy is to challenge the scriptures and either stop the practice of caste or stop believing in the shastras. The problem of caste is thus seen as a problem of overthrowing the authority of the shastras, rather than a problem of social reform.\n\nReference(s):\nThe text provided in the context.",

    "question": "What solutions are proposed?",
    "answer": " The context proposes two main solutions to address the issue of caste:\n\n1. Destroying the belief in the sanctity and infallibility of the shastras (scriptures). This is seen as the root cause of the problem, and until this belief is eradicated, caste will continue to exist.\n\n2. Stopping the practice of caste itself, which can only be achieved by first destroying the belief in the shastras.\n\nThe solutions are presented in the document titled \"The Problem of Caste\" by B.R. Ambedkar.",

They suggest that social reform is like pruning a tree, but the real enemy is the scriptures themselves.\n3. The author asserts that either one must stop believing in the shastras or stop the practice of caste; it is impossible to have both.",
